# Fractals

Make pretty pictures!

## Getting Started

Use Yarn as your package manager

```
npm install -g yarn
yarn
```

Then you're good to go

```
yarn start
```

Head over to localhost/8080 to see your creations!

npm will work as well, but no promises that the thing will build.

Everything is hot-reloaded, so changes to code will automatically propagate to the app.
